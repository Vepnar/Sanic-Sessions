# Sanic-Sessions 0.1.0

### Why does Sanic-Sessions exist?
First of all. I need a simple way to handle sessions in sanic with mongoengine.
The purpose of this repository is mainly to speed up production for my developer exams.

### Will you upload this to PyPi
Probably not. but maybe when a lot of people use this module.

### Installation

#### With pip and git (default)
`py -m pip install git+https://github.com/Vepnar/Sanic-Sessions.git`

#### With pip without git
`py -m pip install https://github.com/Vepnar/Sanic-Sessions/archive/master.zip`


### TODO
- Replace mongoengine with an alternative asynchronous database driver.
- Add Examples
